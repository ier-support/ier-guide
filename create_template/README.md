# Templates


Templates can be set up in a variety of ways. The purpose of a Template is to be able to set up the majority of your Event only one time.

In order to schedule events, you must first have a published Event Template. Nearly all of the functionality that is available within Events can set up within a Template.
Additionally, a majority of the settings can be locked down or made optional.

### Creating a Template

To create a new template, start at the Tenant Homepage and click the Admin button at the top of your screen. Then select Event Templates as shown below.
